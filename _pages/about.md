#### bio

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uiowa.edu) at the 
[University of Iowa](https://www.uiowa.edu) where I lead the [SPARTA Lab](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu) and 
conduct privacy and social computing research. 
Before joining the faculty at UIowa, I worked at the [Data & Society Research Institute](https://datasociety.net) 
and obtained my Ph.D. from [Stony Brook University](https://cs.stonybrook.edu). 
Over the course of my career, I have been fortunate to be the recipient of a

a [Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellowship](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2017/09/13/2017-ford-mozilla-open-web-fellows/),

#### research interests 

My research interests are in the areas of privacy and social computing. 
The focus of my work is to bring transparency to the Internet while improving 
our understanding of the impact of the Internet on our sociopolitical realities. 

Generally speaking, I'm interested in asking the questions: 
"Is X working the way it was intended to work?", 
"What are the consequences of X working in this way?", and 
"What would be a feasible way to mitigate the harms from X?", 
where "X" is usually a tech-related public policy, platform algorithm, 
network protocol, or new networked technology. 
To find satisfactory answers to these questions, I often engage with 
collaborators from law and the social sciences.
